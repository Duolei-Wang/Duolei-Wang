### Hi there ^_^ ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm D. Wang, a chinese student got a BS degree of Math at SUSTech.


- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for some PhD program PLT related.

  Emmm, I realize I'll be in regret in the future if I not try to learn something intereste me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a RA at CUHKSZ.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PLT related.

  I used try to implemnt an assistant theorem prover as my bachelor thesis but failed. So I'm trying to pick it up again. To implement a Programming Language with solid Type System, I think we can do it in steps: 

  1. A good core language(Write an interpreter for this language).
  2. Add Type features for the language.
     1. Simple Type Level.
     2. ...
     3. Dependent Type Level.

  And the progress and archive of codes are listed.

  - [Scheme Interpreter](https://github.com/Duolei-Wang/Scheme-Interpreter).

    With the help of Parser Combinator technicals, we can build a syntax tree easily. Then in a choosen language implemented ParserC, we can do the evaluation.

    To implement a minimal Scheme Interpreter, I think we need the ability to implement "define-syntax" and some primitive functions. After that, we can write a core file in the implemented Scheme itself to build other useful tools.

  - [Simple Typed Lambda Calculus](https://github.com/Duolei-Wang/Dependent-Type-in-Haskell/tree/main/STLC).

    As I'm not so familiar with Scheme right now, also the language is never matters, I choose Haskell to implement some "formalization" of Syntax and Evaluation.

  - TODO:

    Learn Dependent Type Theory implement.

- âš¡ Fun fact:

  - My graduate number at SUSTech is No.64, I think it's a good number XD.
  - I was a vocal in a campus Chinese Rock Band.
  - My lucky number is 7 or 47.
  - I like chocolate flavour Vitamilk very much.
