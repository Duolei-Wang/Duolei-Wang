### Hi there ^_^ ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm D. Wang, a Chinese student who got a BS degree in Math at SUSTech.

I'm looking for some PhD programs in PLT.

  - Public: [duolei.wang@gmail.com](mailto:duolei.wang@gmail.com)

  - Self: [wangdl2020@mail.sustech.edu.cn](mailto:wangdl2020@mail.sustech.edu.cn)

- âš¡ Fun fact:

  - My graduate number at SUSTech is No.64; it's a good number. XD.

  - I was a vocalist for a Chinese rock band on campus.

  - My lucky number is 7 or 47.

  - I like the chocolate flavor Vitamilk very much.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning PLT related.

- I used to try to implement an assistant theorem prover as my bachelor thesis but failed. So, I'm trying to pick it up again. To implement a Programming Language with a solid Type System, I think we can do it in the steps:
  1. A good core language(Write an interpreter for this language).
  2. Adding Type features for the language.
     1. Simple Type Level.
     2. ...
     3. Dependent Type Level.
